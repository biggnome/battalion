battalion is a giant monster game where you are a giant monster
fighting to survive against the military while causing
as much destruction as you can.

a bit of history
<img height=41 width=89 align=middle src="moreBat.html/fsmallright.gif"></h2>

<i>battalion</i> was originally writen in GL(r) on a Silicon Graphics Indy workstation.
This version won 'best Indy game' in the 3rd Indizone Contest, and a
slightly modified version of the game is currently shipping with all Silicon
Graphics Indy and Indigo2 workstations.
I then converted <i>battalion</i> to OpenGL(r) and ported it to other
flavours of UNIX (SunOS, Solaris, Linux, HP-UX, AIX) and to the
Macintosh. These versions are
available from the battalion home page at the link given below.

<p>
<h2> <img align=middle src="moreBat.html/fsmallleft.gif">
see the help screens
<img  align=middle src="moreBat.html/fsmallright.gif"></h2>

The original help files for <i>battalion</i> were created in Showcase(r) which
unfortunately only runs on Silicon Graphics workstations, so I
have converted those screens to GIF files which are viewable from these pages.

<h4>STARTUP HINTS</h4>
<pre>
  The script "battalion" starts the game.

  Press space to select your monster with keys 6 to 9 (Googelon, Techs, the
  Vapour or Flutter), then press 1 to enter monster's view. Move using the
  mouse or arrow keys, shoot with the left button or Ctrl and press Esc to
  exit. The a and z keys tilt the monster's head.

  The s key toggles sound effects and g toggles pointer grab, useful to keep
  the pointer inside the window.

  In demo mode (before and after a game), press h to view the on-screen
  help and H to see the high scores.
</pre>

<br>
<h4>COMMAND LINE OPTIONS</h4>
<pre>
  -a(lone)	    Fight alone.
  -b(ackdrop)	    Hide the overlays.
  -d(etail) n	    Set graphics level-of-detail to 0,1,2. The Mesa version
		    defaults to 0 (low) and OpenGL version to 2 (high). The
		    d key changes the detail level while the game is running.
  -m(usic)	    Initially turn on the background music.
  -s(ound)	    Initially turn on sound effects.
  -lscores¹	    Use local high scores file (in /var/tmp), even if startup
		    script has been set up to access a global high score file.
  -mesa¹	    If OpenGL² is installed, use this option to tell the
		    startup script to run the Mesa instead of OpenGL binary.
  -help		    Shows game version and a list of command line options.
</pre>

<br>
<h4>DEMO MODE COMMANDS</h4>
<pre>
   Space	    Selects your monster (keys 6,7,8,9).
   h		    Displays the on-screen help.
   H		    Displays the high scores.
</pre>

<br>
<h4>PLAY MODE COMMANDS</h4>
<pre>
   Mouse/arrows	    Moves the monster.
   Left button/Ctrl Shoot!
   1, 2, 3	    Selects monster view / overview / army view. Use the
		    i,j,k,l keys to rotate the battlefield in overview mode.
   a, z		    Tilts monster's head.
   d		    Steps through detail levels 0, 1, 2.
   g		    Toggles pointer grabbing, which locks the mouse pointer
		    into the battalion window. Gives you better control if
		    you move using the mouse.
   m		    Toggles background music.
   p		    Pauses the game.
   s		    Toggles sound.
   ESC		    Exit.
</pre>

<br>
<h4>ABOUT SOUND</h4>
<pre>
   The volume is initialized to a low level by audioplay, called from the
   startup script. Change the level/comment out as appropriate.
</pre>

<br>
<h4>ENVIRONMENT</h4>
<pre>
   BATTALIONSCOREDIR  Defines directory for high score file (default /var/tmp).
		    This variable is already defined in the startup script, but
		    the line is commented out.

   BATTALIONSCOREUNIQUE  Setting this variable limits the number of high score
		    entries per user to one (only the top entry). To enable
		    this behavior, uncomment the line in the startup script
		    that defines this variable.

----
¹) The -lscores and -mesa options are handled by the startup script.
²) The Sun OpenGL 1.0 runtime packages must be installed in order to use the
   battalion.opengl binary. OpenGL 1.0 supports only the Creator 3D framebuffer.
